## About the Project

![Top Page Screenshot](./screenshot_top.png)
![Search Result Page Screenshot](./screenshot_results.png)

This project is based on an online shop for electronics.
Instead of that content, I built an online shop for kids' toys with 2 pages as below:

- the main page (search page), with a link to the results page: [index.html](https://raw.githack.com/yocosaka/online-shop/shop/index.html)
- the search results page: [results.html](https://raw.githack.com/yocosaka/online-shop/shop/results.html)

Each of these pages has versions for mainly 2 different screen sizes

- mobile: up to 768px
- tablet & desktop: from 768px

Plus, I added 4 breakpoints to these pages

- tiny mobile: up to 420px
- small mobile: from 460px
- laptop: from 960px
- large desktop: from 1200px

I followed the guidelines of the given design, including:

- colors
- typographies: font face, size, and weight
- layout: composition and space between elements, for the 2 given screen sizes

Please note that some fonts face are used as alternative fonts of Helvetica Neue Light, Medium, and bold because they are not available for free.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful is listed in the acknowledgments.
